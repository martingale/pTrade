{
This general purpose exit strategy is also convenient for use with the other single-
position "discretionary" strategies.  It makes available standard versions of all of 
TradeStation's built-in stops and profit targets in one convenient grouping.

This strategy is preferred over the _StpOrLim Ex strategy when a stop or profit 
target is based on a price differential from the entry price instead of a 
predetermined price point.  It also provides more choices - in addition to a simple 
stop and profit target, it also provides a breakeven stop, 2 trailing stops, and an 
end-of-day exit.  All these exits will always exit the entire position, and will 
always apply to both long and short positions.

The IntrabarOrderGeneration attribute is set to false in this strategy because the
strategy is purely a "wrapper" for built-in stop reserved words, like SetStopLoss,
which evaluate intrabar even when intrabar order generation is disabled.  Disabling
intrabar order generation in this case prevents unnecessary computer processing.
